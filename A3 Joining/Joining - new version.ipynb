    "#### As introduced during lectures, the main advantages of TPC joining via fusion bonding are potential weight reduction, avoidance of drilling induced delaminations and stress concentrations, less labour compared to mechanical fastening. Compared to adhesive bonding, surface treatments are not needed and the process of joining can be sped up dramatically. \n",

After consolidation, this process creates a weld between the surfaces with no visible weld line. To achieve a successful bond, it is necessary to heat the interface above certain temperature thresholds: the glass transition temperature (Tg) for amorphous polymers and the melting temperature (Tm) for semi-crystalline polymers. Additionally, throughout this bonding procedure, it is crucial to ensure that the maximum temperature does not exceed the polymer's degradation point"
